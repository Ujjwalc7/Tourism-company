                    Berhampore is a city and a municipality 
                    in the state of West Bengal, India. As per the 2011 census, 
                    Berhampore has a population of 305,609 and is the seventh largest city 
                    in West Bengal (after Kolkata, Asansol, Siliguri, Durgapur,
                     Bardhaman and Malda). Berhampore is the administrative headquarters of the Murshidabad 
                     district. It is located about 200 km (124 mi) from Kolkata, the state capital. 
                     It is one of the most important business, administrative, educational and 
                     political hub of Bengal as well as of India. Congress Lok Sabha leader 
                     Shri Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has been elected from this city since 1999. 
                     It is one of the most popular urban agglomerations of West Bengal state. 
                     It was the first centre of East India Company in India. Not only the British 
                     but also the Dutch and the French established their companies 
                     in this city and, as a result, it grew as a production hub of 
                     India. It is famous for its famous sweets such as Chanabora, 
                     Manohara, Rasgulla and many more. The city is divided 
                     into five administrative regions: Gora Bazar, Khagra, Indraprastha, 
                     Cossimbazar, Haridasmati. Berhampore was a part of Sepoy Mutiny 
                     of 1857 which took place at Berhampore Cantonment region (Barrack Square). 
                     It was used by many foreign traders as their production hub. 
                     Before becoming a city many janpadas such as Saidabad; Farasdanga; 
                     Kalikapur had become famous. Cossimbazar had also become world 
                     famous for its muslin clothes. This city used to be the headquarters 
                     of Rajshahi administrative region till 1875.

                    Berhampore was fortified in 1757 by the East India Company, 
                    after the Battle of Plassey in June 1757, and it continued 
                    as a cantonment until 1870. But the foundation of the city 
                    of Berhampore remains questionable. Karnasubarna, which is 
                    very near to Berhampore, has a history dating back to 600 
                    AD. Many buildings from the late 1600s can still be seen. 
                    It used to be known as Brahmapur because many of the Brahmin 
                    families settled here. The cantonment was constituted as a 
                    municipality in 1876 and was the headquarters of Murshidabad 
                    district. The Berhampore College was founded in 1853 and in 
                    1888 made over to a local committee, mainly supported by Rani 
                    Swarnamayi. On 27 February 1857, the first major armed battle 
                    of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 took place in Barrack Square, 
                    Berhampore.[3] Berhampore was ruled by Raja Krishnath, his 
                    ancestors and successors (he was succeeded by his sister's 
                    side of the family as he did not have any direct descendants). 
                    In 1901, Berhampore had a population of 24,397, and included 
                    the ancient town of Kasim Bazar.
